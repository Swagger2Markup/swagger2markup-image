# Docker image of Swagger2Markup

Swagger2Markup is a Swagger to AsciiDoc or Markdown converter. The primary goal of Swagger2Markup is to simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that’s been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation produced by Swagger. The result is intended to be an up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, comparable to GitHub’s API documentation. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to swagger-ui and can be served as static content.

Swagger2Markup converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several AsciiDoc or GitHub Flavored Markdown documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification. Internally it uses the official swagger-parser and my markup-document-builder.

The Swagger2Markup-CLI has been published as a Docker image on DockerHub.
